   <h1>Blog Post From Scratch</h1>

   <p>This is the first paragraph.</p>

   <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
    
   <p>This is the third paragraph.</p>

   <p>Here is some more text:</br></br></p>

   <h3 class="tab_dynamic">"Chicago Zen" by A.K. Ramanujan</h3>

   <h3 class="tab_dynamic">I</h3>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">Now, tidy your house,</br>
   dust especially your living room</br>
   and do not forget to name</br>
   all your children </p>

   <h3 class="tab_dynamic">II</h3>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">Watch your step. Sight may strike you</br>
   blind in unexpected places.</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">The traffic light turns <font color=#E67E22>orange</font></br>
   on 57th and Dorchester, and you stumble,</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">you fall into a vision of forest fires,</br> 
   enter a frothing Himalayan river,</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">rapid, silent.</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">On the 14th floor,</br>
   Lake Michigan crawls and crawls</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">in the window. Your thumbnail</br>
   cracks a lobster louse on the windowpane</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">from your daughter's hair</br>
   and you drown, eyes open,</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">toward the Indies, the antipodes.</br>
   And you, alwys so perfectly sane.</p>

   <h3 class="tab_dynamic">III</h3>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">Now you know what you always knew:</br>
   the country cannot be reached</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">by jet. Nor by boat on jungle river,</br>
   hashish behind the Monkey-temple,</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">nor moonshot to the cratered Sea</br>
   of Tranquillity, slim circus girls</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">on a tightrope between tree and tree</br>
   with <font style="background-color:gray;color:white;">white</font> parasols, or the one</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">and only <font color="dodgerblue">blue</font> guitar.</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">Nor by any</br>
   other means of transport,</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">migrating with a clean valid passport,</br>
   no, not even by transmigrating</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">without any passport at all,</br>
   but only by answering ordinary</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic"><b>black</b> telephones, questions</br>
   walls and small children ask,</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">and answering all calls of nature.</p>

   <h3 class="tab_dynamic">IV</h3>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">Watch your step, watch it, I say,</br>
   especially at the first high</br>
   threshold,</p>

   <p class="tab_dynamic">and the sudden low</br>
   one near the end</br>
   of the flight</br>
   of stairs,</p>

   <p class="tab_static">and watch</br> 

   for the last</br>
   step that's never there.</p></br></br></br></br>

   <!-- In the paragraph above, I wanted to see if the .tab class would work as I expected, which was that it would resizing the indent constantly to 10% as I changed the window size. so, I renamed the .tab class to .tab_dynamic and created a new .tab_static, where .tab_static is measured in pixels. I found the number of pixels that matched 10% of my window size exactly when in fullscreen on my current computer. Now, you won't know that this paragraph has a hard-coded indent unless you look at this on a different screen size-->
